I recommend checking out the project at [the following link](https://nbviewer.org/github/YarValerievich/Project3_analysis_moscow_places/blob/main/Project3_analysis_moscow_places.ipynb).

## Purpose: 

It is necessary to prepare a marketing study of the Moscow catering market, find interesting features and present the results obtained, which in the future will help in choosing a suitable place for investors.

## Description: 

During the research, the data was studied, outliers were removed for average checks exceeding 3750 rubles, the area with the least competition was identified, and choropleths with median average checks were plotted.

## Result:

In the dataset, cafes, restaurants, and coffee shops are predominant.

The top 3 spots in terms of the number of seats are occupied by bars and pubs - an average of 124 seats, followed by restaurants with 121 seats and coffee shops with 111 seats.

The share of independent establishments is 61.8%, while chain establishments account for only 38.2%.

Cafes, restaurants, and coffee shops are usually chain establishments, with over 700 establishments in each category. The most popular chain is "Shokoladnitsa," which owns 120 establishments.

The largest number of companies is located in the Central Administrative District, while the least competition is in the Northwest Administrative District.

It is recommended to consider opening establishments with minimal competition, such as bakeries. The bakeries located in the central district have the highest average check, amounting to 1237 rubles.
